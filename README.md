# Python Programs
Just programs for fun and to keep me thinking.

[FreeCodeCamp Python Tasks](https://replit.com/@RonaldGRowe)

## Prime Numbers Script
### Operation
* takes user input for a max number
* finds all prime numbers up to max
* returns list and total number of prime numbers
### Still Finishing
* need to create test script for this program
* working on finding max input
* found out python3 is capable of using numbers as big as memory will allow
* working on reducing runtime
### Learned
* found out while loop was slower than for loop 
* .0782065 seconds faster for 10k numbers
* 5.163216 seconds faster for 100k number
* also incrementing numerator by 2 was used to elimante even options
* this only allowed for minimal gains
* .0144697 seconds faster for 10k numbers incremented by 2 vs 1
* .8526902 seconds faster for 100k numbers incremented by 2 vs 1
* so far max input of 500k numbers a total of 41,538 prime numbers took 144.6112232 secs

## Stock Price Script
### Operation 
* buys at low price and sells at high
* maxamizing profit
* returns profit
* my first leetcode
### Working On
* got it running
* going to try more of these tasks to keep my mind working
* going to create some test to run on this program
